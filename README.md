# Architecture Micro Format

To specify an architecture,
we can use a [microformat](http://microformats.org/) in HTML.

## Essentials

* Nodes to represent components, entities, instances, interfaces, containers,
  servers, databases, whatever.
* Relations to describe the connections between nodes.
  They have an arbitrary number of source and target nodes.
* Attributes to extend nodes and relations with custom data.
* Link mechanism to import stuff from other documents.
